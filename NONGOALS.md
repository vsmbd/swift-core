# SwiftCore Non-Goals

This document defines what SwiftCore explicitly does not attempt to do.

## 1. Not a utilities grab-bag
No random helpers, formatting utilities, or Foundation extensions.

## 2. Not a concurrency framework
No schedulers, futures, reactive streams, or task graphs.

## 3. Not logging or telemetry
No log levels, sinks, metrics, or exporters.

## 4. Not application architecture
No domain logic, UI coordination, or app messaging.

## 5. Not configuration or DI
No global configuration registries or dependency injection containers.

## 6. Not a source of identifiers or synchronization
No correlation identifiers, locks, atomics, or other synchronization primitives.

## 7. Not a performance playground
Avoid unsafe tricks and undocumented behavior.
